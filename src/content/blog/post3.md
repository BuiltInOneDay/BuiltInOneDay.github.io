This was a fun creative project for me to add to my portfolio as I work on Fundamentals of UI/UX Design cert.  Part of the course was to write up case studies and how they help show my work flow. Unfortnately, because this is not a real company, I was unable to get any user feedback.  Maybe I should reach out to NASA or SpaceX?

As a UX/UI designer, my role was crucial in developing a user-friendly interface for the OFS control system. The interface needed to be intuitive, efficient, and reliable, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the station.

#### Problem:
As humanity ventures further into space, the limitations of traditional rocket fuel become increasingly apparent. Long-duration missions are hindered by the weight and volume of fuel, limiting the scope of exploration.

#### Solution:
Orbital Fueling Stations (OFS) offer a revolutionary solution to these challenges. By establishing refueling stations in orbit, spacecraft can refuel in space, extending their mission duration and enabling more ambitious deep-space missions.

#### The Splash Page:

**Image:** Space background and either a space station or astronaut.

**Text:**

**Headline:** Powering the Cosmos<br>
**Subheadline:** Enabling Sustainable Space Exploration, Today and Tomorrow. Fueling the Next Generation of Exploration.<br>
**Call to Action:** Explore Our Vision

By focusing on user-centered design principles and incorporating cutting-edge technology, the OFS interface empowers operators to safely and efficiently manage the refueling process, contributing to the advancement of space exploration.
