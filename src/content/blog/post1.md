Today I was laid off from a company that I have spent the last 12 years working at. This news is undoubtedly sad, and it's natural to feel a range of emotions like disappointment, uncertainty, and even anger. However, I'm hopeful that this unexpected turn of events will lead me to something even better. This is a chance to reassess my priorities, explore new career paths, and discover opportunities that I may have missed before. I'm determined to use this time to grow, learn, and build a fulfilling future.
